Lidia Khait & Vladlena Sotnikova: monster changing shape and format game
First of all, I am happy you were daring enough to create all the logic from your own. Amazing!
The game is really fun and I can see all the work and time you invested on it :) 
Your knowledge about JS is impressive, but unfortanelly we didn't studied it yet so it is not one of the criteria :\
My only comment would be that you didn't use much of the concepts from OOP and Databases 

video presentation in time : yes 10/10
Python OOP: 7/10
Databases: 0/10
API/JSON: 10/10
General score: 8
